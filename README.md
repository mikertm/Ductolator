# Ductolator
Core duct sizing ASHRAE compliant engineering tool.

## Capabilities

- Air duct sizing and equal-friction conversions using ASHRAE/SMACNA practice.
- Plumbing water sizing helpers (Hazen-Williams and Darcy–Weisbach) aligned with
  common U.S. standards (ASHRAE/ASPE/UPC design guidance).
- Embedded pipe material tables (Type K/L/M copper, Schedule 40 steel/PVC, CPVC
  80, PEX) with standard IDs, roughness, Hazen-Williams C factors, and velocity
  limits for hot and cold water services.
- Flow/velocity solvers, pressure-drop aggregation for straight runs and fitting
  losses, and equivalent-length helpers to mirror common sizing chart workflows.
